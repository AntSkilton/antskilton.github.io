Hey I’m Ant, a professional game developer based in London, 
UK, currently working at Moon Studios. I've contributed to a handful of PC & console 
titles over the years including 
[Fall Guys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/),
[Sea of Thieves](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/), 
[Strange Brigade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312670/Strange_Brigade/) & 
[Motorsport Manager](https://store.steampowered.com/app/415200/Motorsport_Manager/).

I'm akin to areas such as UI programming, editor tooling, gameplay systems and pipeline.
I began as an environment artist modelling, sculpting and texture painting. Today, I find problem solving through
code more creative and satisfying.
