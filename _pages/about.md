I’m a London based applications software developer with a background in professional video game development. 
I've contributed to a handful of PC & console titles over the years including 
[Fall Guys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/),
[Sea of Thieves](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/), 
[Strange Brigade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312670/Strange_Brigade/) & 
[Motorsport Manager](https://store.steampowered.com/app/415200/Motorsport_Manager/).

I've always enjoyed interactive technology, I'd say I'm akin to areas such as 
UI programming, UX design, editor tooling, systems creation and content pipeline development.
